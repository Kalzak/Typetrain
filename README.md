# Yoyo readmetime

okay so basically there are a couple deps for python i think you need to get

You need beautifulsoup4, and matplotlib and pynput

should be something like `pip3 install pynput` and etc for the rest
maybe just google how to install them incase I got the names sliigihtly wrong or the install command name is a bit different (eg: bs4 instead of beautifulsoup4)

And yeah then pretty much just run `bash start_client.sh` if you're on linux

otherwise it's a bit more annoying but you can still do it if ur on windows
